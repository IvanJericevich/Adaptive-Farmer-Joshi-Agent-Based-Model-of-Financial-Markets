This repository consists of two source files namely, the Adaptive Model and the Standard Model. Both source codes make use of South African Ô¨Ånancial market data and demonstrate the simulation, testing and implementation of the models in a parallelised framework. Both source codes also present the results of two different model calibrations - Nelder-Mead Simplex with Threshold Accepting and a Genetic algorithm. The code is divided into a number of self explanatory subsections whose description is found in the source files. The data set used is called BRICs-EOD-Compact-2005-2015.xlsx.
