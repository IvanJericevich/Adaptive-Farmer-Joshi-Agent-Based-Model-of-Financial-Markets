This repository consists of two source files namely, the Adaptive Model and the Standard Model. Both source codes make use of South African Ô¨Ånancial market data and demonstrate the simulation, testing and implementation of the models in a parallelised framework. Both source codes also present the results of two different model calibrations - Nelder-Mead Simplex with Threshold Accepting and a Genetic algorithm.
